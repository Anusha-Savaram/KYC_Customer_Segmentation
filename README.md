# DAV Final Project: Advanced Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
"Customer Segmentation - Know Your Customer" is a comprehensive analysis aimed at understanding customers' personalities, spending behaviors, and preferences. This project utilizes k-means clustering to categorize customers into distinct groups, enabling businesses to tailor their marketing strategies effectively and efficiently.

## Key Insights
- **Demographics and Behaviors**: Analysis reveals that the majority of customers are middle-aged, have one or no children, and predominantly hold a Bachelor's degree.
- **Spending Patterns**: Despite lower incomes compared to PhD and Master's degree holders, Bachelor’s degree holders spend the most, indicating a progressive society with varied spending habits.
- **Educational Background Correlation**: Customers with higher educational backgrounds (PhD, Master’s) tend to be around 50 years old, with few outliers in the PhD and 2n Cycle categories.
- **Customer Preferences and Loyalties**: Different clusters show varying behaviors in terms of loyalty to certain products, frequency of store visits, and sensitivity to discounts.

## Clusters Analysis
- **Cluster 0**: High spenders with diverse product interests, frequent store visits, and a propensity for variety.
- **Cluster 1**: A classic example of an experimental group with low income and spend, a potential target for web-based purchases.
- **Cluster 2 & 3**: Show significant consumption of wine, with Cluster 3 being a key potential area for various product lines due to less frequent complaints and a diverse range of product preferences.

## Observations and Recommendations
- All clusters predominantly make in-store purchases and consume wine significantly.
- Clusters 1 and 2 are longer-term customers with Cluster 1 and 3 showing wide product preferences.
- Emphasis on web-based strategies is recommended, focusing on Cluster 0 for its high spend capacity and Cluster 1 for its wide product range appetite.

## Future Scope
- **Business Perspective**: Targeting Cluster 0 due to its high number and spending capacity, and focusing on e-commerce for overhead reduction.
- **Project Perspective**: Incorporating geographic data to assess customer satisfaction across regions and psychographic data to understand customer biases and buying behaviors.

## Technologies and Methodologies
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, NetworkX
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), K-Means clustering, data visualization, network analysis

## Conclusion
This project provides a deep dive into customer segmentation, offering valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies and potential business growth areas. It serves as a pivotal step in understanding customer dynamics and enhancing business strategies.
